# Hello-world

Hi Humans!

Ybs273 is here! I am currently a research scientist at Atmospheric Sciences Research Center (ASRC) of State University of New York (SUNY) at Albany. I am also a system engineer and PI at ecoLong LLC (http://www.ecolongllc.com). The mission of ecoLong is to develop products and solutions that enable higher penetration of renewable energy in the grid. 

I have worked in the fields of instrument development and atmospheric sciences for over 10 years. My work has focused specifically on the development of measurement instruments and technology, internet of things (IOT), remote sensing of aerosol and cloud optical properties, radiative transfer models, and other components of atmospheric and climate research. As a scientific researcher, I have made achievements such as developing environmental Sky Imager Radiometer (eSIR), developing a Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, developing a High Resolution Oxygen A-Band Spectrometer (HABS) with related software and algorithm, validating satellites measurements with in-situ measurements, improving an aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) retrieval algorithm for modeling aerosol’s direct influence on the global climate, and other breakthroughs in climate studies.

The ecoLong Sky Imager Radiometer (e⁻SIR) is a smart sensor system that measures accurate spectral and angular solar radiation distribution, sky conditions, and meteorological parameters for monitoring and forecasting solar radiation and weather conditions. The e⁻SIRs have been deployed onto the New York State Early Warning Detection System, NYS Mesonet (http://www.nysmesonet.org/) , a world-class mesoscale network. This cutting-edge technology has broad applications in weather, climate, solar energy, and air quality.
